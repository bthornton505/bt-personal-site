        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
          After working at the NBA for two years as a Phantom Camera Technician/Production Assistant,
          I found myself at a crossroads. I no longer felt I was growing as a young professional
          and realized I no longer enjoyed the career I had studied in college.
        </p>
        <p>
          This pushed me to explore new opportunities which led me to discover the
          Flatiron School, a programming bootcamp, and enroll in an online full-stack developer course.
          I had no experience with code but always had a love for solving problems, and coding was just what I needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fast-forward 10 months from when I started and I have officially graduated
          from this course with experience in building apps with Ruby on Rails, React, and a list of other technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          The skills I have learned throughout this process have truly been life
          changing and I know that whatever challenges I am faced with can be overcome.
          This mindset is something I will bring with me everyday into the workplace,
          and given the chance to join your team, I will prove that my work ethic will be my strongest quality.
